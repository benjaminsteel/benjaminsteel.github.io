When you fall,<br/>sharp crystals slice my tired skull;<br/>the weight pulls me down.<br/><br/>Winds wail in the ripe<br/>morn. A busy breeze touches<br/>my neck with shivers.<br/><br/>As I wait for march,<br/>I notice a blue jay out<br/>the foggy window. <br/><br/>I chant: audacem<br/>faciebat amor. My love<br/>above mental toll. </p1></div><div class="col-1"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OTLVxGts_y4o1oS5bTSkEWGS8NiQoVt7?usp=sharing">Collection of Literature Essays</a></div></div><div class="flex flex--space-around"><div class="col-2"><p> Bay Waves (winner of The Ponton Prize for College Times at Upper Canada College)</p><p1>Late August by the beach on the Georgian Bay,</p1><br/><p1>We see all the sand and the rocks and the mud, </p1><br/><p1>Quiet under the sun, below the anxious surface,</p1><br/><p1>Like her bones.</p1><br/><p2>Late August by the beach on the bay we feel the balmy air, </p2><br/><p2>Poles from prude July:</p2><br/><p2>She’s hauling blue-green waves that tease and slap, </p2><br/><p2>And circulating the draft with smells of Heinz, hotdogs, wet dogs, and cigarettes.</p2><br/><p3>We notice early September on our </p3><br/><p3>Toes more cold than wet.</p3><br/><p2>Roll me up the sun she calls </p2><br/><p2>and steps</p2><br/><p2>Back closer to me</p2><br/><p2>While the waves roll</p2><br/><p1>Over, declarative and flat.
